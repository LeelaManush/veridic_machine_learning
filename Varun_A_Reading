Varun_Assignment_Reading
U to Z:

Underfitting:
It is like a failed model which has not learnt anything based on the given data. It is not recommended to use this model/algorithm.

Univariate Analysis:
In this analysis we compare and analyze the dependency of one predictor and response variable. 

Unsupervised Learning:

This method is not used to predict or estimate but it is used to segregate data into sets or make sense of the data.

Variance:
It gives a sense of how scattered the given data points are from the mean.

Z-test:
It is a complicated variance test(sort of).

Zookeeper:
Itâ€™s an open source API software which allows clients to receive consistent data as it syncs distributed processes in large systems.
