Python Installation on Windows 10:
 
It is highly unlikely that your Windows system shipped with Python already installed. Windows systems typically do not. Fortunately, installing does not involve much more than downloading the Python installer from the python.org website and running it. Let’s take a look at how to install Python 3 on Windows:
 
Step 1: Download the Python 3 Installer
1.	Open a browser window and navigate to the Download page for Windows at python.org.
2.	Underneath the heading at the top that says Python Releases for Windows, click on the link for the Latest Python 3 Release - Python 3.x.x.( 3.6 or 3.7 is fine).
3.	Scroll to the bottom and select either Windows x86-64 executable installer for 64-bit or Windows x86 executable installer for 32-bit.
Step 2: Run the Installer
1.	Once you have chosen and downloaded an installer, simply run it by double-clicking on the downloaded file. 
2.	Then just click Install Now. That should be all there is to it. A few minutes later you should have a working Python 3 installation on your system.
 
 
Python Installation on Mac OS X:
 
Step 1: Install Homebrew (Part 1)
To get started, you first want to install Homebrew:
1.	Open a browser and navigate to http://brew.sh/. After the page has finished loading, select the Homebrew bootstrap code under “Install Homebrew”. Then hit Cmd+C to copy it to the clipboard. Make sure you’ve captured the text of the complete command because otherwise the installation will fail.
2.	Now you need to open a Terminal app window, paste the Homebrew bootstrap code, and then hit Enter. This will begin the Homebrew installation.
3.	IF AND ONLY IF: you’re doing this on a fresh install of macOS, you may get a pop up alert asking you to install Apple’s “command line developer tools”. You’ll need those to continue with the installation, so please confirm the dialog box by clicking on “Install”.
 
At this point, you’re likely waiting for the command line developer tools to finish installing, and that’s going to take a few minutes so go grab a coffee!
 
Step 2: Install Homebrew (Part 2)
You can continue installing Homebrew and then Python after the command line developer tools installation is complete:
1.	Confirm the “The software was installed” dialog from the developer tools installer.
2.	Back in the terminal, hit Enter to continue with the Homebrew installation.
3.	Homebrew asks you to enter your password so it can finalize the installation. Enter your user account password and hit Enter to continue.
4.	Depending on your internet connection, Homebrew will take a few minutes to download its required files. Once the installation is complete, you’ll end up back at the command prompt in your terminal window.
Whew! Now that the Homebrew package manager is set up, let’s continue on with installing Python 3 on your system.
 
Step 3: Install Python
Once Homebrew has finished installing, return to your terminal and run the following command:
HOME$  "brew install python3" (without the double quotes).
Note: When you copy this command, be sure you don’t include the $ character at the beginning. That’s just an indicator that this is a console command.
This will download and install the latest version of Python. After the Homebrew brew install command finishes, Python 3 should be installed on your system.
You can make sure everything went correctly by testing if Python can be accessed from the terminal:
1.	Open the terminal by launching Terminal app.
2.	Type pip3 and hit Enter.
3.	You should see the help text from Python’s “Pip” package manager. If you get an error message running pip3, go through the Python install steps again to make sure you have a working Python installation.
Assuming everything went well and you saw the output from Pip in your command prompt window. You're half way through our machine learning course introduction, Keep going!
 
 
 
 
Install Anaconda Navigator:
 
1.	Installing navigator is pretty easy either for windows or mac os x
2.	Go to : https://www.anaconda.com/download/ (the website should recognize your OS as soon as you open)
3.	If not, choose the type of OS you have beside Download for: and download the installer. 
4.	Installer should be the version of python you installed in previous step.
5.	Run the installer and it should prompt you license agreement etc. Press continue.
6.	At one point, The prompt asks you to install Microsoft VSCODE, if you haven't installed vscode IDE, please do install it at this stage.
7.	Once the installation is done, Windows OS should have anaconda navigator in their start menu, mac os x users should be able to find it in the applications menu.
8.	Tadaaa! You've installed Anaconda navigator. 
 
Setup github account:
1.	Create a github account for public use just like how you create your facebook account right here: https://github.com/
2.	Press sign up if this is your first time. (read git commands here, the page is pretty much self explanatory: https://dzone.com/articles/top-20-git-commands-with-examples )
3.	Press sign in if you already have an account. ( you should be able to  use git command if you have an account).
 
Install VS Code:
1.	Go to URL: https://code.visualstudio.com/download and download the installer based on OS.
2.	Run the installer and you should be able to figure out the next steps by yourself. 
3.	Ctrl + shift + p for windows, command + shift + p for mac os  should open command palette in vs code.
4.	In command palette, search for option " install code command in path " and press enter. This step should install code script into your path automatically.
5.	You're all set!
